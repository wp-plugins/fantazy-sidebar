Fantazy Sidebar Makes wordpress's sidebar floatable, with less code & more performance.

== Description ==

First thing i have to notify, is that this plugin is not a pure release, 
means that its just a new version of an old deprecated wordpress plugin : strx floating sidebar,
so i decided to refresh this plugin by a new clean version compatible with the latest wordpress core systeme,
with less code, and new wordpress functions, for a better website's security.
Fantazy Sidebar, keeps the same optionalities as the old verion, but i have deleted some debuging non useful functions
to make the plugin more simple, and i also deleted all ads inside the plugin backend

now if your sidebare is too short comparing to your content, Fantazy Sidebar w'll make you sidebar floatable
